### Info/credits
This is a script that is a work in progress. It was originally inspired and copied from Heath Adams' PNPT course, which was borrowed from @thatonetester/sumrecon.
More tools will be added over time, in order to automate some of the pentest processes that I conduct. 

## Installation
